# Parabeac Core: Our Open Source Conversion Tool

Why go to 8 months of effort to build a new tool, just to have developers around the world roaming through the source code?

Easy. Parabeac builds apps for developers, so who better to ensure our tool quality? Frankly, the developers we built this tool for could probably build it themselves (though, honestly, we think we did a pretty sweet job). Our belief is that the quality of Parabeac code should be defined not by us, but instead by the real-time consensus of the global developer community.

We love what we do at Parabeac. Most of us live out in far West Texas but we honor and respect the global developer community, from Mountain View to Shanghai. We know an ocean of global enthusiasts will make Parabeac better in ways we could never have envisioned by ourselves. They will configure and change to fit what their real requirements are, not what we thought their requirements might be. In short, we want Parabeac Core to be the clear pool of open source code into which every developer around the world can see a bit of their own reflection.

So welcome.
